          My Manifesto
          ------------
          I like making good software. I like designing, creating specifications, testing and solving the core problem. I like documenting my software, automating inefficiencies
          and reviewing code. I want my code to be used my millions of people. I want to create solutions to big problems. I want to work with hardware at the lowest
          levels. I want to work with large distributed systems. I don't want to create web sites for the rest of my life. I want to work on things that are hard. I  don't care about
          social media, etc. I want to use vim at work. I care about disrupting the music industry, personal finance, telecommunications and education. If you can satisfy some of the things I want, please schedule
          and interview.
