title: Dissecting My Vim Configuration

---

Here I dissect my `vim` configuration, something that I am slightly proud of
because I think it is pretty nifty. My `vim` configuration, relative to my home
directory, has three files:

#. `.vimrc` Which contains the bulk of my configuration.
#. `.gvimrc` Which contains configuration related to `gVim` only.
#. `.vim/` Which contains plugins, file type specific configuration and some
other esoteric stuff.
