I have a strong passion for building quality software. I take pride in my creations
and strive to create the most optimal solution for any given problem.

far I have worked at the following fine companies:

  <span class='company-position'> Software Developer </span>
  <span class='company-term'>     Fall 2011 </span>

  <span class='company-term'>     Winter 2011 </span>
* <span class='company-name'>     Trapeze Group </span>
  <span class='company-position'> Programmer </span>
  <span class='company-term'>     Spring 2010 </span>
